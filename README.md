## nearlydue


An exercise in learning the Go programming language, this wee lil web scraper looks up borrowed items on 
a certain public library's website, and sends an email reminder when something is nearly due for return.

To use config-sample.toml to config.toml, edit for auth info, and run nearlydue in the same directory.
